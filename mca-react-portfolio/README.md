# 🎓 MCA Academic Portfolio

A curated collection of academic projects built during my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) 2022. This portfolio showcases a range of frontend, backend, full-stack, desktop, and algorithmic projects — all aimed at strengthening my understanding of real-world development.

> ✨ From writing my first lines of code in Nagpur, India to deploying complete full-stack apps — this is where my journey began.
