# 🎓 Academic Projects – MCA (RTMNU Nagpur, India – 2022) [![MCA](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCA_(2022)-RTMNU_Nagpur,_India-blueviolet)](https://nagpuruniversity.ac.in/)

Welcome to my collection of academic projects built during the Master of Computer Applications (MCA) program at Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University (RTMNU), Nagpur in 2022.

These projects were built as part of my MCA curriculum and reflect my foundational experience in frontend, desktop, and full-stack development. They've laid the groundwork for my current focus on scalable, production-grade full-stack applications using Spring Boot and ReactJS.

## 📚 Technical Highlights from MCA

### 🎨 Frontend Development (ReactJS)

- Built interactive UIs using **React.js** with component-based design
- Styled responsive layouts using **Tailwind CSS** and plain **CSS3**
- Implemented live data rendering via **public APIs** (e.g., Weather API)
- Developed **algorithm visualizations** using state-driven animations
- Designed static music player and search UIs using reusable components

---

### 💻 Desktop & Form-Based Applications (Java)

- Developed a Java desktop app (**StayMate**) using **Java Swing**
- Used **JDBC** to connect with **MySQL** and perform data operations
- Designed login forms, user dashboards, and room booking features
- Applied object-oriented principles to build modular Java classes

---

### 🛠️ Full-Stack Development (MERN)

- Created a full-stack food delivery app (**Food Fusion**) using **MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js**
- Integrated **Stripe Payment Gateway** for checkout and orders
- Used **React Router** and conditional rendering for user/admin flows
- Managed frontend and backend folder structure independently

---

### 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Strengthened foundation in **frontend frameworks** and **backend logic**
- Practiced database design (relational and NoSQL)
- Gained exposure to **end-to-end web development**
- Built confidence in deploying real-world academic projects independently

## 🧠 Reflection: Why These Projects Matter

Each project helped me:
- Build confidence with Git/GitHub workflows
- Translate theory into working apps
- Understand real challenges in UI/UX, DB design, and code structure

These projects laid the groundwork for my transition from academic learning to real-world full-stack development.
