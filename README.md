# 🎓 Academic Projects – MCA (RTMNU Nagpur, India – 2022) [![MCA](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCA_(2022)-RTMNU_Nagpur,_India-blueviolet)](https://nagpuruniversity.ac.in/)

Welcome to my collection of academic projects built during the Master of Computer Applications (MCA) program at Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University (RTMNU), Nagpur in 2022.

These projects reflect my foundational experience in frontend, desktop, and visual programming — and laid the groundwork for my current focus on production-ready full-stack development using Spring Boot and ReactJS.
