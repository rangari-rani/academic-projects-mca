## 📚 Academic Context

These projects were developed as part of my MCA curriculum in 2021–2022.  
They helped me solidify my understanding of:

- Frontend component-based architecture
- Full-stack data flow and deployment
- Problem-solving with algorithmic thinking
- UI/UX design for both web and desktop platforms

I'm now actively working with **Java + Spring Boot**, REST APIs, and monolithic based architectures.
