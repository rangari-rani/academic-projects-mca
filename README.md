## 📚 Technical Highlights from MCA

### 🎨 Frontend Development

- Built interactive UIs using **React.js** with component-based design
- Styled responsive layouts using **Tailwind CSS** and plain **CSS3**
- Implemented live data rendering via **public APIs** (e.g., Weather API)
- Developed **algorithm visualizations** using state-driven animations
- Designed static music player and search UIs using reusable components

---

### 💻 Desktop & Form-Based Applications

- Developed a Java desktop app (**StayMate**) using **Java Swing**
- Used **JDBC** to connect with **MySQL** and perform data operations
- Designed login forms, user dashboards, and room booking features
- Applied object-oriented principles to build modular Java classes

---

### 🛠️ Full-Stack Development (MERN)

- Created a full-stack food delivery app (**Food Fusion**) using **MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js**
- Integrated **Stripe Payment Gateway** for checkout and orders
- Used **React Router** and conditional rendering for user/admin flows
- Managed frontend and backend folder structure independently

---

### 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Strengthened foundation in **frontend frameworks** and **backend logic**
