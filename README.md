# 🎓 Academic Projects – MCA (2021–2022)

Welcome to my collection of academic projects built during my MCA (Master of Computer Applications) studies (2021–2022). These projects span frontend, backend, full-stack web apps, desktop applications, and algorithm visualizations — showcasing a broad range of technologies and problem-solving approaches.

Each project folder contains its own README with detailed documentation, tech stack, and screenshots.

## 📚 Academic Context

These projects were developed as part of my MCA curriculum in 2022–2023.  
They helped me solidify my understanding of:

- Frontend component-based architecture
- Full-stack data flow and deployment
- Problem-solving with algorithmic thinking
- UI/UX design for both web and desktop platforms

I'm now actively working with **Java + Spring Boot**, REST APIs, and monolithic based architectures.
