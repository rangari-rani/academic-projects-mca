# 🧭 Dijkstra Visualizer – Grid-Based Pathfinding App (React)  

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)

An interactive visual tool that demonstrates Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm on a 2D grid. It highlights how the algorithm explores nodes and calculates the most efficient path between a starting point and a destination.

## 📚 About This Project  

Originally built during MCA (2022), this grid-based visualizer brings Dijkstra’s algorithm to life—showing how it navigates nodes, avoids walls, and finds the shortest path.  

While simple in scope, it reflects strong fundamentals in:  
- Pathfinding logic and algorithmic thinking
- DOM manipulation and dynamic UI rendering
- Grid traversal and user-driven interactivity
- Visual debugging of step-by-step algorithm behavior

> 🕒 Organized and published later for clarity, learning, and portfolio presentation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** – Component-based rendering, state management
- **[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)** – Core algorithm logic for Dijkstra traversal  
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** – Used for styling and responsive layout using class-based utilities

## 🔄 What Came Next

This visual project deepened my interest in interactive UIs, which I later applied to full-stack platforms with real-world data and scalable architecture.  

After this, I began building **full-stack applications** with **ReactJS** and **Spring Boot**, adding real API integrations, role-based auth, database persistence, and modular monolithic structures.

📌 **Explore my pinned GitHub repositories to see full-stack platforms built beyond the academic phase.**
