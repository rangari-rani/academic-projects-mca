# 📍 Dijkstra Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive visual tool to visualize **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm** on a 2D grid. Built using **React**, it shows how the algorithm traverses nodes and finds the shortest route between a start and an end point.

## 📚 About This Project

This project was developed during my **MCA academic phase (2022)** to explore how Dijkstra’s algorithm works visually.  
The goal was to better understand pathfinding logic by rendering grid-based animations where walls and weights impact traversal. It uses React and vanilla JS logic to update the grid based on user input and algorithm steps.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** – Component-based rendering, state management
- **[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)** – Core algorithm logic for Dijkstra traversal  
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** – Used for styling and responsive layout using class-based utilities
