# 🔢 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer – React

An interactive visualizer of popular sorting algorithms built using **React** during my **MCA phase (2022)**. It helps understand how each algorithm works step-by-step by animating array comparisons and swaps in real-time.

## 📚 About This Project

This was one of my early GUI projects during MCA where I used **Bootstrap 4.4.1** directly via **CDN** to handle all the layout, and components styling — no custom CSS or SCSS setup was required. It helped me quickly prototype UI with grid, buttons, and modals using only class names.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Component-based UI rendering and state management
- **JavaScript** – Core logic for sorting algorithms and animations
- **Bootstrap 4.4.1 (via CDN)** – Used for styling and responsive layout using class-based utilities

## 🧠 What I Learned

- `useState`, `useEffect`, `setTimeout`, and animation sequencing in React
- Visual mapping between data structure (array) and UI
- How sorting algorithms work in detail — performance and behavior
- Handling dynamic component rendering using array mapping

---

## ⚠️ Limitations (MCA Phase)

- No backend or code download/export
- Single-threaded animation (can’t interrupt mid-sort)
- No dark/light theme toggle
- Sorting only numeric arrays (no strings/objects)

## 🔄 What Came Next

Since this MCA project, I've worked on advanced full-stack applications with authentication, role-based systems and more.
