# 🔢 Sorting Visualizer – React App for Algorithm Animation  

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)  

An interactive visualizer of popular sorting algorithms built using **React**. It helps understand how each algorithm works step-by-step by animating array comparisons and swaps in real-time.

## 📚 About This Project  

Originally created during MCA (2022), this project visualizes how popular sorting algorithms work—through animated bars that rearrange in real-time.  

While simple, it reflects key frontend learning milestones like:  
- React state and effect management (useState, useEffect, setTimeout)
- Visual mapping between arrays and UI elements
- Basic animation sequencing and DOM reactivity
- Bootstrap 4.4.1 usage via CDN—no custom CSS setup

> 🕒 Organized and published later for clarity, learning, and portfolio presentation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** – Component-based UI rendering and state management
- **[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)** – Core logic for sorting algorithms and animations
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** – Used for styling and responsive layout using class-based utilities

## 🔄 What Came Next

This project sharpened my grasp of React state management and interactive UI patterns—foundational skills I built on in later projects.

After this, I began building **full-stack applications** with **ReactJS** and **Spring Boot**, adding real API integrations, role-based auth, database persistence, and modular monolithic structures.

📌 **Explore my pinned GitHub repositories to see full-stack platforms built beyond the academic phase.**
