## 📚 About This Project

This streamplay - music player was originally built during my MCA in 2022 as part of my early learning  React fundamentals, component styling with Tailwind CSS, and audio element handling.  
While I now focus on more advanced full-stack and scalable applications, this project reflects my strong foundation in frontend logic and API integration. 

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** – Dynamic frontend UI
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – Utility-first CSS for styling
- No backend or API — **songs and metadata are embedded locally**

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 **Inbuilt Music Library**: Static songs/albums embedded directly
- ▶️ **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, replay, toggle switch, volume control
- 🧠 **Quote Generator**: Get inspired with random motivational quotes
- 🎵 **Now Playing Section**: Displays current track, album art
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes, mobile to desktop

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- React state management (`useState`, props)
- Handling audio tags & local assets
- Tailwind layout and utility classes
- Designing without APIs or databases

---

## ⚠️ Limitations (MCA Phase)

- No user login or authentication
- Music library is not dynamic (hardcoded songs)
- No playlist customization or uploads

---

## 🔄 What Came Next

Since this MCA project, I've worked on advanced full-stack applications with authentication, role-based systems, microservices, and more.
