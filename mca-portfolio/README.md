# 💼 Academic Portfolio – MCA   

A curated collection of web, desktop, and algorithmic projects developed during my Master of Computer Applications (MCA).

These projects reflect the shift from academic learning to hands-on application — building a strong base in frontend, backend, and full-stack development.   
> 🕒 Originally built during MCA and later organized, refined, and published for clarity, learning, and portfolio presentation.
