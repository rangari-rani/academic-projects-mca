A curated collection of web, desktop, and algorithmic projects developed during my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at RTM Nagpur University in 2022.

These projects reflect the shift from academic learning to hands-on application — building a strong base in frontend, backend, and full-stack development.

> ✨ MCA provided the core programming foundation — from Java to building complete, working systems across platforms.
