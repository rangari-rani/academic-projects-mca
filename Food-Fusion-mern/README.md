## üìò Academic Context

 Originally built during my MCA (2022), this project helped me learn:  
 - Full-stack request/response cycle
 - State management and routing in React
 - Token-based security using JWT
 - Payment integration using Stripe

I am now focused on **Java + Spring Boot** full-stack applications, REST APIs, and monolithic architecture design.
