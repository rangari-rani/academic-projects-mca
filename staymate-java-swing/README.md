StayMate is a desktop-based application built using **Java Swing** that allows users (e.g., property managers) to manage room listings, student allocations, and amenities like Wi-Fi, food, and bed type.

## üìö About This Project  

Originally created during MCA (2022), this project simulates student allocations, room listings, and amenity tracking.  

While offline and desktop-based, it reflects strong fundamentals in:  
- Swing-based GUI design and form handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- JDBC for persistent data storage (CRUD operations)
- Modular Java classes for core features (rooms, students, amenities)
- Multi-window UI and input validation

> üïí Organized and published later for clarity, learning, and portfolio presentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **[Java Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/)** ‚Äì For designing desktop UI components (`JFrame`, `JTable`, `JTextField`, `JCheckBox`, etc.)
- **[JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/)** ‚Äì For connecting and querying relational databases (e.g., MySQL)
- **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** ‚Äì Backend database for storing users, room data, and categories
- **[NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/)** ‚Äì Used for drag-and-drop UI, form builder, and Java GUI development

## üîÑ What Came Next

This project laid the foundation for my transition from desktop-based Java applications to full-stack web development using modern frameworks.  
 
After this, I began building **full-stack applications** with **ReactJS** and **Spring Boot**, adding real API integrations, role-based auth, database persistence, and modular monolithic structures.

cd staymate-java-swing
```

## 2. Import project into your IDE  

- Open with NetBeans (recommended) or IntelliJ
- Make sure the MySQL JDBC driver is added to your classpath

## 3. Setup MySQL database  

- Update your DB connection in ConnectionProvider.java
